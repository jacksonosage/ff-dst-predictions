ADD
nfldb=> insert into team values ('JAX','Jacksonville','Jaguars');
nfldb=> insert into team values ('LAC','Los Angeles','Chargers');

UPDATE play SET pos_team = 'JAC' WHERE pos_team = 'JAX';
UPDATE play SET pos_team = ’SD’ WHERE pos_team = 'L';

REMOVE
DELETE FROM team WHERE team_id = 'JAX';
DELETE FROM team WHERE team_id = ‘LAC’;
